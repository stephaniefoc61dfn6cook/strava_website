To connect a user's Strava account to your website, you can follow these steps:

Implement the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow:

Set up a client-side authentication flow using JavaScript to redirect the user to the Strava authorization page.
Once the user grants permission, Strava will redirect them back to your website with an authorization code.
Retrieve the authorization code:

On your website's server-side, receive the authorization code passed as a query parameter from the Strava redirect.
Validate and securely store the authorization code for further processing.
Exchange the authorization code for an access token:

Use the authorization code to make a server-side request to Strava's token endpoint.
Include your client ID, client secret, and redirect URI in the request.
Receive the access token and other relevant information from the token response.
Store the access token:

Store the access token securely in your database or session storage, associated with the user who authenticated with Strava.
This will allow you to make API requests on behalf of the user in the future.
Integrate with the Strava API:

With the user's access token, you can make API requests to retrieve data from their Strava account.
Use the access token in the Authorization header of your API requests.
Implement the desired functionality:

Utilize the Strava API endpoints to fetch and display the user's activities, profile information, or any other relevant data.
Integrate the data seamlessly into your website's user interface.
